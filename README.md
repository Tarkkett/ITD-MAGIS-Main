# MAGIS FTC Team Repository

This repository is a **FORK** of the public **FTC SDK** for the **INTO THE DEEP** (2024-2025) competition season written by [Rokas Kirdulis](https://github.com/Tarkkett).

## Overview

- The `teamcode` folder contains the main command-based control system for the robot.
- This folder includes custom classes and methods designed specifically to support autonomous and teleoperated (teleop) modes for our team's robot.
- Code is structured to enhance modularity, making it easy to test individual components and integrate new features throughout the season.

## Key Components

### Subsystems
The `teamcode` directory is organized around the **command-based model**, with specific **subsystems**( or `managers` as I call them) for each part of the robot:
- **Drivetrain** - Manages all drive motors and movement algorithms, including odometry and trajectory following.
- **Intake** - Controls the robot's intake system, with positional controls for `TiltServo`, `PitchServo`, `ClawServo` and `YawServo`. Used for picking up game elements.
- **Outtake** - Manages the opening and closing of the `DepositorClawServo`, as well as positional controls for the `PitchServo`, `YawServo` and `TiltServo`.
- ~~**Ascent** - Used for control of the `LegMotor` and variuos Ascent sequances. ~~
  
### Autonomous and Teleop Modes
- **Autonomous**: Pre-defined routines to perform tasks at the start of the game utilizing motion planning.
- **Teleop**: Driver-controlled routines that provide manual and assisted control over the robot.

### State Machine

Our robot uses a **State Machine** design pattern to organize and manage various states and transitions that occur during the competition. The state machine makes it easy to control and update the robotâ€™s behavior in both **autonomous** and **teleoperated** modes, ensuring smooth transitions between tasks.

#### Key Concepts
- **States**: Each state represents a distinct behavior or action that the robot performs (e.g., driving, lifting the arm, grabbing objects).
- **Transitions**: The state machine allows for the robot to transition from one state to another based on specific conditions, such as sensor inputs or time.
- **State Management**: The state machine runs continuously, checking conditions to decide when to enter, execute, or exit states.
  
### Additional Resources
- **README** files within each subsystem folder for in-depth descriptions of classes and methods __will be created soon__.
- Code comments throughout to assist with debugging, testing, and modifications by new team members or collaborators.

Our team wishes You happy coding and best of luck for the **INTO THE DEEP** season!
